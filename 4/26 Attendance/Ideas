Ideas:  
    - Quackchat: Snapchat but it doesn't suck and it's for only Stevens students  
    - Psychologial support app  
        - sign up as supporter or supportee  
    - Crowdsourced "what dogs are on campus?" app  
        - This app will allow college students to pin where dogs are on campus in real time. 
        Students can then down vote the pin if the dog has left. They can also 
        indicate whether or not the dog owner is willing to let students pet 
        the dog. Students near the dog will be able to rate it on how much of 
        a good boy it is.
